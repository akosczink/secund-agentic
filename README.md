# SECUND Shield – Dignity-First Agentic Retention Engine

Autonomous retention & burnout prevention system that **never tracks, scores, or surveys employees**.

Zero surveillance · 18 self-improving loops · Dignity as the only invariant

### Run it in 10 seconds (right now)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akosczink/secund-agentic.git

### The vision
- 18 interconnected agentic loops (Individual → Team → Systemic)  
- Dignity is non-negotiable – overrides all business logic if needed  
- No activity tracking, no mood forms, no screenshots – still more accurate than surveillance-based tools
