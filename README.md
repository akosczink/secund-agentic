# SECUND AGENTIC

**Dignity-first agentic decision loops — autonomous retention & burnout prevention engine (SECUND OS).**

This repository contains the first public prototype of the **SECUND Agentic Science Engine** —  
a dignity-first, autonomous prediction → intervention → reflection loop designed to protect
human wellbeing inside modern organizations.

---

## 🚀 What this agent does

- predicts churn / burnout risk  
- designs *dignity-first* interventions (no surveillance, no productivity-policing)  
- performs autonomous actions when thresholds are crossed  
- reflects on outcomes and improves itself  
- based on **18 SECUND self-improving loops**  
- zero-tofu, deterministic decision core

## 📘 Full Architecture

This includes the **18 agentic loops**, the tri-level architecture  
(Individual → Organizational → Systemic), and the V1 retention model.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`src/agentic-retention-loop.ts`** — core retention/burnout loop (v0.1)  
- **`src/retention-agent.ts`** — high-level agent wrapper  
- **`package.json`** — minimal TS runtime  
- **`tsconfig.json`** — strict TS settings  
- **`.gitignore`** — TS-ready

## 🧠 Philosophy

**Human dignity is the invariant.  
Agentic autonomy is the engine.  
Reflection is the governance.**

We build systems that help people — not systems that control people.
