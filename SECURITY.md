❌ What This System Will Never Do
To protect human dignity, SECUND will never include:
❌ surveillance features
❌ keystroke logging

✔️ What We Strictly Protect
SECUND ensures:

🔐 Encryption & Data Handling
Even in prototype state:

no raw personal data is stored on disk
all loop evaluations run in ephemeral, purge-safe memory

Security is dignity.
Dignity is the invariant.
