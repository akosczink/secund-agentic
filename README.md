# SECUND AGENTIC — Research Prototype

**Autonomous, dignity-first agentic decision loops for retention & burnout prevention (SECUND OS).**

This repository hosts the **first public research prototype** of the  
**SECUND Agentic Science Engine** — an autonomous, dignity-first  
*prediction → intervention → reflection* loop designed to improve  
human wellbeing inside modern organizations.

---

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

- Predicts churn & burnout risk using structured signal pathways  
- Designs *dignity-first* interventions (no surveillance, no productivity-policing)  
- Executes autonomous actions when thresholds are crossed  
- Reflects on outcomes and self-adjusts  
- Built on **18 SECUND self-improving loops**  
- Zero-tofu, deterministic decision core  

This prototype demonstrates the fundamental mechanisms behind the  
upcoming **SECUND OS** real-world retention engine.

## 📘 Complete Architecture

The full architecture — including all decision loops, diagrams,  
mechanisms, and multi-level system mapping — is documented in:

👉 **[BOOK_OF_LOOPS.md](./BOOK_OF_LOOPS.md)**

This includes:
- the **18 agentic loops**  
- the **tri-level architecture**  
  (Individual → Organizational → Systemic)  
- the **V1 retention model**  
- evaluation notes

This structure will expand as additional loops and integrations  
enter the public layer of the project.

## 🧠 Philosophy

**Human dignity is the invariant.  
Agentic autonomy is the engine.  
Reflection is the governance.**

We design systems that support people —  
*never systems that monitor or control them.*

## 🛣️ Public Research Roadmap

- Agentic Wednesday demo  
- Burnout multi-loop expansion (v0.2)  
- Team-level + systemic loop integration (v0.3)  
- Supabase + Stripe activation  
- Employer pilot ×3  
- SECUND OS integration bridge (v1.0)
