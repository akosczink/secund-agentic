# SECUND AGENTIC

**Dignity-first agentic decision loops — autonomous retention & burnout prevention engine (SECUND OS).**

This repository contains the first public prototype of the **SECUND Agentic Science Engine** —  
an autonomous, dignity-first prediction → intervention → reflection loop for protecting human
wellbeing inside modern organizations.

### 🚀 What this agent does
- predicts churn / burnout risk  
- designs a *dignity-first* intervention (no spyware, no humiliation, no productivity-police)  
- reflects on outcomes and self-improves  
- zero-tofu, deterministic core  
- built on 18 SECUND self-improving loops  

### 📁 Current files
- `src/agentic-retention-loop.ts` — v0.1 retention/burnout agent  
- `package.json` — minimal TS runtime  
- `.gitignore` — TS-ready  

### 🧠 Philosophy
**Human dignity is the invariant.  
Loop autonomy is the engine.  
Reflection is the governance.**
