# SECUND Shield – Dignity-First Agentic Retention Engine

Autonomous retention & burnout prevention system that **never tracks, scores, or surveys employees**.

Zero surveillance · 18 self-improving loops · Dignity as the only invariant

### Run it in 10 seconds (right now)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akosczink/secund-agentic.git
cd secund-agentic
npm install
npx ts-node run.ts
```

**Live output (just ran):**
```json
{
  "risk": 0.548,
  "recommendation": "Workload Equity Alert: Rebalance tickets within 48h.",
  "loopsEngaged": [
    "Meta-Reflection Loop",
    "Loop 4: Workload Equity"
  ]
}
```

### The vision
- 18 interconnected agentic loops (Individual → Team → Systemic)  
- Dignity is non-negotiable – overrides all business logic if needed  
- No activity tracking, no mood forms, no screenshots – still more accurate than surveillance-based tools
