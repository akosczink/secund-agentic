# SECUND AGENTIC — Research Prototype

**Autonomous, dignity-first agentic decision loops for retention & burnout prevention (SECUND OS).**

This repository hosts the **first public research prototype** of the  
**SECUND Agentic Science Engine** — an autonomous, dignity-first  
*prediction → intervention → reflection* loop designed to improve  
human wellbeing inside modern organizations.

---

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

- Predicts churn & burnout risk using structured signal pathways  
- Designs *dignity-first* interventions (no surveillance, no productivity-policing)  
- Executes autonomous actions when thresholds are crossed  
- Reflects on outcomes and self-adjusts  
- Built on **18 SECUND self-improving loops**  
- Zero-tofu, deterministic decision core  

This prototype demonstrates the fundamental mechanisms behind the  
upcoming **SECUND OS** real-world retention engine.

## 📘 Complete Architecture

The full architecture — including all decision loops, diagrams,  
mechanisms, and multi-level system mapping — is documented in:

👉 **[BOOK_OF_LOOPS.md](./BOOK_OF_LOOPS.md)**

This includes:
- the **18 agentic loops**  
- the **tri-level architecture**  
  (Individual → Organizational → Systemic)  
- the **V1 retention model**  
- evaluation notes
